General idea of the DAO pattern:

	- For each entity, there will be an object responsible for making
the access to data related to this entity. Example
	
		- Client: ClientDao
		- Product: ProductDao
		- Request: RequestDao

	- Each DAO will be defined by the interface.
	- The dependency injection can be made by the project Factory pattern.
